# String Concatenation  
This is the process of joining two or more strings together.  
**Using the + operator**  
```
let text1 = "Happy ";
let text2 = "Birthday!";
let fullText = text1 + text2;
console.log(fullText); // Output: Happy Birthday!
```
**Using the += operator to append to an existing string**  
```
let message = "You're ";
message += "welcome.";
console.log(message); // Output: You're welcome.
```
**Using template literals**  
Template literals use backticks (`) and '${}' placeholders for variables.
```
let action = "bouncing";
let gender = "baby boy";
console.log(`It is a ${action} ${gender}`); // Output: It is a bouncing baby boy
```
